This is going to be the best day of your life. We are going... to build... our first... IPHONE APPLICATION. Wooo! 

We are finally going to create a very simple iPhone application that you can show to girls or guys at the bar and eveyrone will swoon over you to the point where you will get annoyed and just want to be a shut in and program more iPhone applications... ok well maybe not as intense as that possible scenario, but you never know!

Lets do this. 

## Creating the Project
Start by loading up Xcode, but instead of opening a playground file, go to File > New > Project. You should then see the following window:
![New Project]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/intro-1/start.png)

Select <b>Single View Application</b>. iOS projects have a bunch of different templates to choose from. We will get into templates in later tutorials.

There are not a bunch of options to choose from:
![Options]({{ site.url }}{{ site. baseurl }}/assets/images/intro-1/options.png)
