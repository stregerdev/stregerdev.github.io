Before we can start getting into making iPhone applications, we need to register to be an Apple developer. All we need is an Apple ID to start. If you already have an Apple ID, you can use that. If not, then you will need to create one.

Go ahead to the [Apple Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/). On the top bar you can explore the different portions of the site (Learn to Code, Software Downloads, etc). What we are looking for is to create an account. Go to account on the top right bar and sign in with your Apple ID.

There will be a Terms of Service that you will have to agree to. After submitting you can then Join the Apple Developer Program.
