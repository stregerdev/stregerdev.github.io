Hi! I'm Josh, and welcome to my tech/personal/whatever blog!

So pretty much: I created this website thingy to put all of my nerdy thoughts down while also becoming a famous blogger in the process. I am currently a student at the University of Delaware pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development and Cyber Security. I'm obsessed with tech and aesthetics, and my life is an adventure (screw you Insider, I came up with that slogan first).

Stay tuned for frequent lessons, rants, explorations, and other posts of that nature.
