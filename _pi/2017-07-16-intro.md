How's it going everyone. So i decided to make this tutorial series because I recently received a raspberry pi 3 as a gift. Unlike most people, being gifted a palm sized linux box excites me, so why not document my attempts to fiddle around with it. My first endeavor is going to be creating a home environment measuring desktop. 

There's actually a lot of literature on this subject online, so most of this tutorial will probably be some form of regurgitation, but I'll try to be very clear about every step I took in order to fully set up the initial measuring system.

First things first, let's set up the pi:

## Setting up your first raspberry pi
If you already have a pi with an OS on it, then you can skip this section entirely. I myself received a blank 16GB micro sd card so I needed to install the OS from scratch. 

This can be done following the directions from the [Raspberry Pi Start Guide Docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/quickstart/)

Here are the steps simplified:
1. Download [SD Formatter 4.0](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html)
2. Install the software
3. Insert the SD card into your computer (you may need a micro sd to usb adaptor).
4. Format the SD Card
5. Visit the Raspberry Pi Downloads Page and download [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
6. Unzip the download, and drag all of the files in the NOOBS folder and drop them into the SD card drive
7. Pop out the SD card and put it into your Raspberry Pi
8. Plug in your raspberry pi and watch the magic happen
9. Select and operating system on startup and let it download (I selected raspbian)

Awesome you should have successfully downloaded Raspbian and are now on the desktop of your Pi's OS. Connect to your wifi network (upper right corner).

## Upgrading and Securing your Raspberry Pi

If we are going to use our pi for home automation and other projects that involve connecting to our wifi, we need to make sure it is updated, upgraded, and secure.
